      <p>Hello and welcome to my web site, I know there is not much content at the moment
         but over the next few months I will be adding more. I will be uploading
         information about myself and also things I have been working on such as class assignments. 
         I hope you like what you see and thank you for visiting and next time there might be some improvements.
      </p>
